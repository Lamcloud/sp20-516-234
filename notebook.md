**Why are we using virtual environments in this class?**

Virtual environments allow for you to isolate your dependencies needed for development from the rest of your machine.
In this class we will be developing multiple small scripts and one much larger project that may require different dependencies.
By working exclusively within a a venv it is possible to run multiple projects with different versions of various packages
to see the impact of package updates on your development. If needed you can configure your solutions completely differently
in multiple virtual environments to compare and contrast the impacts on the performance results. These are only a few of
the reasons we would be using venvs in this course besides just getting good practice!
