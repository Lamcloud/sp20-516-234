# Outline 

## Introduction 

- pre compiled models
- what are ML models?
- ASIC?
- Advanced neural network processing on low power devices (mission statement)
- what are neural networks again?
- PERFORMANCE BABY, big performnace cost reduction (big seller and major purpose of this existing)
- look into the popular vision models (wtf are these?)

## Overview of Coral project

- What's an inference speed?
- What's an inference?
- inferences locally vs in the cloud?
- TF lite
- the custom debian derivative...

## Edge TPU Accelerator overview 

- prototyping vs production
- why this is better 
- read up on keras... jesus this is like every nerual entwork buzzword 
- models and tensor flow lite 
	- wtf is quantizing?
- on device training how does that work? 
- wtf are deep feedorward neural networks
- model specifica characteristics
- wtf is trasnfer learning
- read up on ML training

## Real world use cases 

## on embedded devices vs the cloud
